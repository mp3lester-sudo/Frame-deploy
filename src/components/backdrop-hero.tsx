 * long as `playsinline` is set). A small speaker toggle lets people opt
 * into sound; an X lets them dismiss the trailer back to the plain still.

              ~5.7:1 on a wide monitor) -- nothing like a video's native
              16:9, the same "wrong fit" problem the backdrop still image
              had before object-cover. This is the iframe equivalent of
              object-fit: cover: since this hero is full-bleed (100vw wide,
              no side padding), sizing the iframe to 100vw wide by its true
              16:9 height (56.25vw) and centering it always yields a height
              taller than this box, so the parent's overflow-hidden crops
              the vertical excess instead of letterboxing or squashing the
              video the way a plain inset-0 fill would.

              controls=0 strips YouTube's persistent play/pause bar,
              scrubber, volume, and fullscreen button during active
              playback; disablekb and fs=0 close off the keyboard- and
              fullscreen-button paths to the same chrome; iv_load_policy=3
              suppresses annotation cards. pointer-events-none means the
              video can never register a tap/click at all -- the mute and
              close buttons layered on top are the only interactive things
              in this hero. None of that touches YouTube's own branded
              title/channel header, though, which shows at the top of the
              embed any time it isn't confirmed actively playing (queued,
              buffering, paused) -- no URL parameter can turn that off. The
              solid-to-transparent band + wordmark below permanently masks
              that exact zone instead, regardless of playback state. */}
